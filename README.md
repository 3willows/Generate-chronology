# About

Early experimental project to let lawyers create a paragraph-referenced Word chronology automatically.

[Write up](https://technical-blog.3willows.xyz/2024-10-21-generate-chronology-first-steps/) on how (and why) the code was flued together.

## Help wanted!

- Code: likely to refactor in light of the current glued-together approach taken.

- Security analyses

- Plans of attack for additional features: page numbers, accepting PDF files as input

- Demo
